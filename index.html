          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am an enthusiastic web developer based in the Philippines. My
            journey into the world of web development commenced during the
            pandemic, a challenging period that turned out to be a pivotal
            moment. It was then that my uncle introduced me to programming,
            sparking a deep passion within me. Witnessing the transformative
            power of code, I became captivated by its ability to bring ideas to
            life.
          </p>

            As a self-taught developer, my innate love for learning and tackling new challenges has fueled my journey. I approach the learning process with enthusiasm, constantly seeking to broaden my skills. Currently, I am immersed in studying Data Structures and Algorithms. This endeavor allows me to explore different approaches to problem-solving, delve into diverse methods of storing and retrieving data, and optimize the performance of my code. My commitment to continuous improvement drives my ambition to contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving landscape of web development.
